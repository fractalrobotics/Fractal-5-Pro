# Fractal 5 Pro

The Fractal 5 Pro is an open source benchtop multidirectional 5-axis 3D printer.

üíª An open-source 5-Axis slicer application was developed to go along with this printer. You can check out [the GitHub page for it here](https://github.com/fractalrobotics/Fractal-Cortex) to download it for free.

# Product Overview


# Project Motivation
This project was motivated by the **Fractal Robotics** vision: **To accelerate the development of mechanical solutions.** In support of this vision, this project aims to address the observed gap between the limitations of 3-axis FDM and the inaccessibility of current 5-axis FDM.

**üìãLimitations of 3-Axis FDM**
  - Part strength is limited due to the direction of printing
    - Parts often fail when forces are applied parallel to the direction of layer lines
    - Stacking layers in only one direction limits design freedom
  - Overhangs require support structures
    - The process of removing supports often damages or destroys a part
    - Support structures waste material

**üîíInaccessibility of Existing 5-Axis FDM**
  - Options for existing 5-Axis slicer applications are limited
    - Most non-planar slicing requires significant training on advanced CAM softwares and are not compatible with all geometries
  - Most commercially available 5-Axis 3D printers are huge and expensive

**üåâBridging the Gap**

The observations listed above prompted an investigation into the needs of 3D printing practitioners across different industries. The result was the development of both the [Fractal Cortex](https://github.com/fractalrobotics/Fractal-Cortex) slicer and the Fractal 5 Pro printer.

# üîéProduct-Market Fit
Dozens of potential customers were interviewed to determine 3D printing needs, budgets, and expectations across different industries. This process helped inform and focus design decisions.

**üîëKey Customer Needs Translated to Design Decisions**

My response to the customer interviews was to design an accessible product package (hardware & software) that addressed the shortfalls of 3-axis FDM while still being easy to use.

# Note From the Author to the Community
Hi, my name is Dan Brogan, and I spent 3 years (2022-2025) bootstrapping a startup called Fractal Robotics while working part time jobs. Over those 3 years, I developed technical acumen in end-to-end robotics product development, improved my communication skills, and learned a great deal about what goes into running a startup. 

My career goal has always been and continues to be **to contribute to society through technology in a way that has a positive impact**. That goal was translated into the vision of Fractal Robotics, which is "to accelerate the development of mechanical solutions".

At this point, I am unable to continue volunteering my full effort into this project. While I won't be stepping back entirely, I have decided the best course of action is to release both the [Fractal Cortex](https://github.com/fractalrobotics/Fractal-Cortex) slicer and designs for the Fractal 5 Pro under an open source license so that others can learn from, build upon, and contribute to it. 

Open sourcing this project allows me to stay true to the original vision of Fractal Robotics. By sharing my work, I hope to support researchers, developers, educators, and makers exploring similar ideas.

I'm excited to see where others take this work next.

# FAQ's

**What does this printer do that others can't?**
- It provides all of the following in one product: high reliability, stronger parts, more design freedom, less waste material, large build volume, intuitive user experience, and ease of maintenance at a relatively affordable price.

**What is multidirectional 5-axis 3D printing?**
- Multidirectional 5-axis slicing is a technique in which a 3D model is divided into sub-volumes (chunks) and each chunk is sliced in a different direction. This allows users to define multiple slicing directions for a given part. The result is a gcode file with toolpath instructions that include reorienting the part relative to the printhead after each successive chunk is printed. This approach is distinct from non-planar slicing, which modifies the surface of each layer to follow the curvature of the model's shape.

**Why focus on multidirectional slicing instead of non-planar printing?**
- Non-planar slicing often requires significant training in advanced CAM software and tends to be computationally expensive. In contrast, multidirectional slicing provides many of the same benefits of 5-axis 3D printing - such as directional strength control and reduced support requirements - within a more accessable and familiar workflow. 

- From a hardware standpoint, multidirectional 5-axis 3D printers avoid an important mechanical limitation of non-planar 5-axis 3D printers. Since they don't require the printhead to be long and thin to achieve tight angles, multidirectional printers can achieve much higher print speeds with far less vibration. That said, non-planar slicing is an exciting and evolving area of research, and ongoing developments will hopefully make that method more accessible as well.

**Why FDM? Why not SLA or SLS?**
- FDM printers are low maintenance, have an easy & clean setup, and are compatible with a large selection of affordable materials. Further, since FDM is the printing method that is most impacted by orthotropy, it stands to benefit the most from 5-axis technology.

**Why Direct Drive instead of Remote Drive?**
- The customers interviewed tend to favor printers that are compatible with a wide selection of feedstock materials, including softer filaments. TPU needs direct drive to print effectively since it's so soft. Using remote drive to extrude soft filaments would be like pushing on the end of a string to get the far end to move, which doesn't work very well.

**How is the print bed heated if it can spin infinitely? Wouldn't the wires get twisted up?**
- We use a high current slip-ring to transfer power to the rotating shaft.

# üìùFuture Work
- Redesign print bed gimbal for higher rigidity
  - Use 1/4" thick aluminum sheets instead of 1/8"
  - Rearrange A-Axis bearing assembly to minimize unsupported shaft length
  - Incorporate larger corner gussets
- Change A-axis pulley drive to a high ratio gear drive
- Convert cable-chain wire harness system to CAN-bus
- Integrate accelerometer into printhead for input shaping (resonance cancellation)
- Instead of using the inductive probe for centering the print bed, use a sensor that has better defined sensing radii in the X and Y directions
  - The same centering routine can be used, but a different sensor solution is needed

If you build a Fractal 5 Pro and discover any other problems, please let me know.
